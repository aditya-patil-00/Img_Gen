# Stable Diffusion Image Generation

#Overview

Welcome to the Stable Diffusion Image Generation repository! This project includes two Colab notebooks that showcase the capabilities of Stable Diffusion models for generating and editing images. The notebooks are designed for text-to-image and image-to-image generation, providing a versatile approach to creative tasks.

#Notebooks

text_to_image.ipynb

This notebook demonstrates text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion. Users can input a text description, and the model will generate an image based on the provided prompt. Additionally, the notebook calculates metrics to assess the quality of the generated image.

image_to_image.ipynb

This notebook explores image-to-image editing with Stable Diffusion. Users can input an image and use text prompts to modify it creatively. Similar to the text-to-image notebook, it includes code to evaluate the quality of the output image.

#Requirements

This code is designed to be run in Google Colab notebooks.
Ensure you have a running Colab instance with GPUs enabled for optimal performance.
Refer to the Colab documentation for assistance with setting up your environment.

#Instructions

- Open the Desired Notebook

- Double-click on either "text_to_image.ipynb" or "image_to_image.ipynb" in your Colab environment.
 Run the Notebook Cells

- Click the "Run" button (play triangle) next to each code cell. Follow any prompts to mount your Google Drive or  upload necessary files.

#Experiment with Prompts

In the designated code cells, enter your text descriptions for image generation or modify input images with creative text prompts.

#Visualize the Results

The notebook will generate images based on your input prompts, accompanied by calculated quality metrics. These metrics can help assess factors such as realism, detail, and adherence to the prompt.
